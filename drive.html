            <h2>Join Our Team</h2>
            <p>Be part of our driving community! We won't charge you to use this website as a rider. Everything the passenger gives you is yours. You would have to pay for your own fuel. 
                Drivers/riders who would like to drive for us are required to submit a valid government id card, their driving license, the details of their car, the rc book, registration and insurance.
                Once the drivers/riders are cleared by our team, they are good to go
            </p>
