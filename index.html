            <h2>Welcome to Hitch. Your new non-imaginary friend.</h2>
            <p>Find the best rides with Hitch.
                We are not a regular Transportation service like Ola or Rapido.
                We have a fantastic new solution that is great for both the riders and the passengers.
                With Hitch you do not have to worry about the ever rising fuel prices or traffic.
                Hitch is an app designed to give a low cost hassle free ride specifically for students.
                Immigrant students are victims of over priced autos and taxis. 
                Hitch is an app where these students can Hitch a ride with their fellow students who have a vehicle. If the local student is going to their home and the place the immigrant student wanted to visit someplace middle, the local/rider can drop him/her in the desired place for a very minimal price or no charge at all if the driver feels so.
                The rider does not have anything to lose. They take the usual route they take to go somewhere. They just have to drop someone else on their way and they get paid for this.
                The passenger can make a new friend for life too. This way they can Escape from exhorbitant auto fares. Stay Smart, Say Hitch!. Here is your rider Mr. Tom Cruise, on his way to pick you up (we are just kidding. We do not encourage drivers like these)
